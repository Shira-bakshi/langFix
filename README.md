# LangFix

LangFix is a browser extension that automatically fixes text typed in the wrong keyboard language.

If you accidentally type in Hebrew instead of English (or vice versa), LangFix detects the mistake and converts the text instantly — no need to delete or retype.

## Features
- Automatic detection of incorrect keyboard language  
- Instant conversion between Hebrew ↔ English  
- Works in input fields, textareas, and forms  
- Simple, fast, and lightweight  

## Who is this for?
LangFix is designed for bilingual users who frequently switch between Hebrew and English and want a smoother, interruption-free typing experience.

## How it works
LangFix analyzes the typed text, detects the keyboard layout mismatch, and converts the characters to the correct language in real time.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open your browser’s extensions page

4. Load the extension folder  

## Future Improvements
